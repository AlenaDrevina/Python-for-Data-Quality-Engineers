# Python_for_DQE_7

## Python Basics
##HW_Module_1
```bash
Create a python script:

1)create list of 100 random numbers from 0 to 1000
2)sort list from min to max (without using sort())
3)calculate average for even and odd numbers
4)print both average result in console
```
##HW_Module_2
```bash
Write a code, which will:

1)create a list of random number of dicts (from 2 to 10)

dict's random numbers of keys should be letter,
dict's values should be a number (0-100),
example: [{'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'g': 11}, {'a': 3, 'c': 35, 'g': 42}]

2)get previously generated list of dicts and create one common dict:

if dicts have same key, we will take max value, and rename key with dict number with max value
if key is only in one dict - take it as is,
example: {'a_1': 5, 'b': 7, 'c': 35, 'g_2': 42}
```

##HW_Module_3
```bash
homEwork:

  tHis iz your homeWork, copy these Text to variable.

 

  You NEED TO normalize it fROM letter CASEs point oF View. also, create one MORE senTENCE witH LAST WoRDS of each existING SENtence and add it to the END OF this Paragraph.

 

  it iZ misspeLLing here. fix“iZ” with correct “is”, but ONLY when it Iz a mistAKE.

 

  last iz TO calculate nuMber OF Whitespace characteRS in this Tex. caREFULL, not only Spaces, but ALL whitespaces. I got 87.
```

##HW_Module_4
```bash
Refactor homeworks from module 2 and 3 using functional approach with decomposition.
```

##HW_Module_5
```bash
Create a tool, which will do user generated news feed:

1.User select what data type he wants to add

2.Provide record type required data

3.Record is published on text file in special format

 

You need to implement:

1.News – text and city as input. Date is calculated during publishing.

2.Privat ad – text and expiration date as input. Day left is calculated during publishing.

3.Your unique one with unique publish rules.

 

Each new record should be added to the end of file. Commit file in git for review.
```

##HW_Module_6
```bash
Expand previous Homework 5 with additional class, which allow to provide records by text file:

1.Define your input format (one or many records)

2.Default folder or user provided file path

3.Remove file if it was successfully processed

4.Apply case normalization functionality form Homework 3/4
```

##HW_Module_7
```bash
Calculate number of words and letters from previous Homeworks 5/6 output test file.

Create two csv:

1.word-count (all words are preprocessed in lowercase)

2.letter, cout_all, count_uppercase, percentage (add header, spacecharacters are not included)

CSVs should be recreated each time new record added.
```

##HW_Module_8
```bash
Expand previous Homework 5/6/7 with additional class, which allow to provide records by JSON file:

1.Define your input format (one or many records)

2.Default folder or user provided file path

3.Remove file if it was successfully processed
```

##HW_Module_9
```bash
Expand previous Homework 5/6/7/8 with additional class, which allow to provide records by XML file:

1.Define your input format (one or many records)

2.Default folder or user provided file path

3.Remove file if it was successfully processed
```

##HW_Module_10
```bash
1.Different types of records require different data tables

2.New record creates new row in data table

3.Implement “no duplicate” check.
```
